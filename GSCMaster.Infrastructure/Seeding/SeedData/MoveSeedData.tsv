Sleep Talk	Does nothing if the user is awake. If the user asleep, it randomly performs one of its attacks. If Rest is selected, user recovers its HP and stays asleep for two more turns. Sleep Talk can choose an attack that has run out of PP; the generated attacks also do not cost PP, and it cannot generate itself, Bide, Disabled attacks or two-turn attacks with a charge-up turn like Fly or Skull Bash. (Moves with a recharge turn like Hyper Beam can be generated.)	Normal	10	Copy	N/A
